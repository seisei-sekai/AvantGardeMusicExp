Since I have experience developing such music, I first think of how to create a catchy drum set, a middle-freq range instrument, a lead, and a bass timbre. Statistically speaking, any 21st style commercial music must have a drum set(a kick, a snare, hi-hat, a crash), a bass, a lead(melody), and a middle-range instrument(guitar) in the music arrangement to attain spectral fullness from both temporal and frequency domain.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>To obtain this effect, I select the sample with viola and a sample of tape. The reason for me to choose the viola is simple: From the frequency domain. It is the only sample with fixed pitch and rich overtone distribution (containing lots of non-integer-related overtones). From the temporal domain, the timbre envelope also changes interestingly by bowing in an inharmonic way. So, I choose the viola as the sound source for my lead, guitar, and bass formation.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I selected the tape sample for a similar reason: I want a sound source containing as much f0-frequency variant &#8216;sound seed&#8217; as possible to construct a drum set timbre. From my experience, a punchy kick drum sound should have an f0 around at 60hz frequency and have a resonance at around 100-300hz with a low amplitude hi-hat shimmering high-frequency sound over 6000hz. So, I first segmented the sound source into nine different isolated events and applied the ADSR filter with a quick attack and nearly no SR to obtain a percussive sound for all nine different sounds. At the sound formation stage of a kick drum, I first noticed that in one of the sounds I segment, when I play it at a half sample rate, a salient 60hz frequency would appear along with other unwanted high frequencies. So, at this stage, I use a low pass filter to filter out the high-freq noise and select a sample with high frequency to do an addition synthesis. By adding more f0 variant version (50-70) 60-Hz sound sources by addition synthesis, I obtain a kick sound roughly in the end. Later on, I also compress the kick sound to make it punchier by fl-Soundgoodizer. For the snare drum, I also use the same technique to form the timbre. One thing worth mentioning is that I load a Native Instrument studio drum kick drum sample by Kontakt in advance to do the Short-time Fourier transform to see how a real kick drum looks. This process is helpful in forming my timbre.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>On the tonal timbre side, the work is more manageable now compared to the percussive sound groups. For the lead timbre, I autotune the original bow sound with starting point playing in the middle of the sample to obtain a typical string instrument sound. I also apply an ADSR filter by fl sampler with low Attack and a little bit of release to pertain to the cuttingness feeling of the timbre in the temporal dimension. However, doing this may make it sound unnatural to some extent, so I added a Guitar effector in Wave bundle with some delay and reverberation to obtain a non-distorted amplified E-guitar timbre. After obtaining the lead timbre, I decide to take the lead as a sound source to form my bass timbre. From my point of view, Bass timbre is not hard to create because you do not have to care about the mid and high-frequency components very much. After all, those ranges are occupied by lead and another instrument in music arrangement. So, I apply two strong low pass filters with a cutoff frequency around 300 Hz in addition to 2 low frequency-enhanced compressors. And this moment, I just finished my bass timbre. I also take the lead as the sound-seed for the guitar timbre and pass it to NI GuitarRig 5 to add guitar effectors. I select pre-amp, amp, EQ, and distortion to make it sound like a metal guitar. And then duplicate the timbre to the extreme left and right pan with 2 or 3 ms onset time difference to obtain a stereo Haas effect since the tone sounds so non-spatial. And this is my journey in creating the timbre.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>From a musical form design perspective, I plan to use {Intro-buildup-Drop-Drop2-Interlude-buildup-drop1-drop2} music form. For the Intro, I have played around the lead timbre for a long time and finally decided to make it into Maqam-styled music with a drone timbre to make it sound exotic. Due to the limitation of the sound source, I create lots of sliding and glissando effects in the connection of notes and usage of double harmonic scales (Gypsy Scale) to obtain the feeling of the attached genre. In the percussion, I accidentally find it pretty sounds like djembe or Arabic drum when I play it in the high-frequency domain, so I also make a drum pattern resembling that sound.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>I just applied a telephone-tone EQ with automation to create spectral contrast with the upcoming exciting DnB -styled drop at buildup.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At the drop, I make standard DnB drum loops with stereo-swapping hi-hats timbre. At the same time, I use lead, distorted guitar, and bass to create a dramatic pitch contrast and rhythm contrast to make the music sound exciting. At drop2, I also apply similar philosophy as the Intro here but with the bass playing a lower octave note at sub-bass resembling the hip-hop music.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>At Interlude, I want to let the audience&#8217;s ears rest because the previous part is so exciting. So, I use the lead in a very minimalistic way with an upcoming chord cluster. In the chord clusters, I design the melody in the interval required the maqam and build up the corresponding minor seven chords. However, I want to shift it to more western-style tonality later, so I use a diminished chord to finish the transition and enter into a very standardized iio7\u00e0V\u00e0i with a tritone substitution technique. After an interlude, the music form repeats from drop1.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Due to time limitations, I only do a rough mixing stage and not do refined mixing and mastering stage. But hopefully, the music I make conveys the essential musical idea that entirely transforms the two sound samples into an exciting story.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Sample used:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>viola_bowPressure.aiff<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>tapeMeasure_shuffle.aiff<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Genre:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>Exotic \/ Arabic style + Drum and Bass + Hip-hop<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Instrumentation (sound creation)<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong>Lead, Distorted Guitar, Bass, Kick, Snare, hi-hats group<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Musical Form<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>{Intro-buildup-Drop-Drop2-Interlude-buildup-drop1-drop2}<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Music theory used:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong>Gypsy scale, Neopolitan chord, tritone-sub, some complex jazz chord<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mixing technique used:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong>EQ, compression, reverb, distortion<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Mastering technique used:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong>N\/A<\/p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img loading=\"lazy\" decoding=\"async\" width=\"1024\" height=\"576\" src=\"https:\/\/shichengzhang.web.illinois.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/final_assembling-1024x576.png\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-626\" srcset=\"https:\/\/shichengzhang.web.illinois.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/final_assembling-1024x576.png 1024w, https:\/\/shichengzhang.web.illinois.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/final_assembling-300x169.png 300w, https:\/\/shichengzhang.web.illinois.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/final_assembling-768x432.png 768w, https:\/\/shichengzhang.web.illinois.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/final_assembling-1536x864.png 1536w, https:\/\/shichengzhang.web.illinois.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/final_assembling.png 1920w\" sizes=\"auto, (max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" \/><figcaption>An overview of the project<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-video\"><video height=\"512\" style=\"aspect-ratio: 512 \/ 512;\" width=\"512\" controls src=\"https:\/\/shichengzhang.web.illinois.edu\/wp-content\/uploads\/2021\/10\/lucid_mysong.mp4\"><\/video><figcaption>GAN-generated MV for Mutant.mp3<\/figcaption><\/figure>\n","protected":false},"excerpt":{"rendered":"<p>Abstract: Mutant is an experimental electroacoustic composition implementing a Gypsy scale for Phrygian tonality.
