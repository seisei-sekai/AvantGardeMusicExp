After thousands of hours of keyboard improvisation and composition by iterative methodology before college, I developed my harmony idioms, including non-tertian harmony and jazz voice leading. I am also intrigued by the soundscape phenomenon lurking in every corner of the world and thinking about how to reverse engineer these auditory stimuli by sound synthesis algorithms and attempting to develop a Basic Formal Ontology (BFO) and Music Phylogeny (MP) to draw a big picture on how different sound phenomena related to each other.<\/p>\n\n\n\n<p>During my college years, I was trained with scientific methods across different disciplines. In engineering, my main focus was on digital signal processing, statistical machine learning, and musical information retrieval. In the 2020 Summer, I was interned at&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/www.tencentmusic.com\/en-us\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Tencent Music Entertainment<\/a>&nbsp;as an algorithm researcher developing a chord mining system for millions of pop songs. In psychology, my main interest lines in neurolinguistics and the neuroanatomy of musical creativity. Starting from 2021 August, I am a research assistant learning EEG-based methodology at the&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/publish.illinois.edu\/uiucelplab\/\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Electrophysiology and Language Processing Lab<\/a>&nbsp;at the U of I. In music college, I was taught by&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/music.illinois.edu\/faculty\/heinrich-taube\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Prof. Heinrich Taube<\/a>&nbsp;on the topic of algorithmic composition for symbolic music generation and&nbsp;<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https:\/\/music.illinois.edu\/faculty\/james-w-beauchamp\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Prof. James Beauchamp<\/a>&nbsp;on the topic of Musical Information Retrieval. As a Gen-Z adolescent, I am a big fan of Japanese Pop Jazz and have abundant experience in music production with DAW.
